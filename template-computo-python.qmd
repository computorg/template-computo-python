# Introduction

## About this document

This document, accompanied by the [customized GitHub repository](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-python/), provides a template for writing contributions to **Computo** [@computo].

::: {.callout-tip}
## Note
This document provides only the key formatting principles. For a detailed, step-by-step guide on preparing your article and submitting it to Computo, please consult the [guidelines for authors](https://computo-journal.org/site/guidelines-authors.html).

## Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a versatile formatting system for authoring documents integrating markdown, LaTeX and code blocks interpreted either via Jupyter or Knitr (thus supporting Python, R and Julia). It relies on the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) document converter.

## Requirements

You need [quarto](https://quarto.org/) installed on your system and the [Computo extension](https://github.com/computorg/computo-quarto-extension) to prepare your document. For the latter, once quarto is installed,  run the following to install the extension in the current directory (it creates a `_extension` directory which is ignored by git thanks to `.gitignore` by default):

```.bash
quarto add computorg/computo-quarto-extension
```

[`Python`](https://www.python.org/) and [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/install) must be installed on your computer.

# Formatting

This section covers basic formatting guidelines for quarto documents.

To render a document, run `quarto render`. By default, both PDF and HTML documents are generated:

```.bash
quarto render # renders both HTML and PDF
```

## Basic markdown formatting

**Bold text** or _italic_

- This is a list
- With more elements
- It isn't numbered.

But we can also do a numbered list

1. This is my first item
2. This is my second item
3. This is my third item

## Mathematics

### Mathematical formulae

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) code is natively supported[^lualatex], which makes it possible to use mathematical formulae:

[^lualatex]: We use [lualatex](https://lualatex.org/) for this purpose.

$$
f(x_1, \dots, x_n; \mu, \sigma^2) =
\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp{\left(- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \mu)^2\right)}
$$

It is also posible to cross-reference an equation, see @eq-mylabel:

$$
\begin{aligned}
D_{x_N} & = \frac12
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
x_L^\top & x_N^\top \end{array}\right] \,
\left[\begin{array}{cc}  L_L & B \\ B^\top & L_N \end{array}\right] \,
\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_L \\ x_N \end{array}\right] \\
& = \frac12 (x_L^\top L_L x_L + 2 x_N^\top B^\top x_L + x_N^\top L_N x_N),
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-mylabel}

### Theorems and other amsthem-like environments

Quarto includes a nice support for theorems, with predefined prefix labels for theorems, lemmas, proposition, etc. see [this page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs). Here is a simple example:

::: {#thm-slln}
## Strong law of large numbers

The sample average converges almost surely to the expected value:

$$\overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{\text{a.s.}}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.$$
:::

See @thm-slln.

## Python Code

Quarto uses either Jupyter or knitr to render code chunks. This can be triggered in the yaml header. In this tutorial, we use `Jupyter`  (`Python` and `Jupyter` must be installed on your computer).

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
author "Jane Doe"
jupyter: python3
---
```

`python` code chunks may be embedded as follows:

```{python python-code}
import numpy as np
x = np.random.normal(0, 1, 10)
x
```

## Figures

Plots can be generated as follows:

```{python stem-plot}
#| label: fig-stem-plot
#| fig-cap: "A basic Stem plot"

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0.1, 2 * np.pi, 41)
y = np.exp(np.sin(x))

plt.stem(x, y)
plt.show()
```

It is also possible to create figures from static images:

:::{#fig-logo}

## Tables

Tables (with label: `@tbl-mylabel` renders @tbl-mylabel) can be generated with markdown as follows

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
: my table caption {#tbl-mylabel}

## Handling references {#sec-references}

### Bibliographic references

References are displayed as footnotes using
[BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/), e.g. `[@computo]` will be displayed
as [@computo], where `computo` is the bibtex key for this specific
entry. The bibliographic information is automatically retrieved from
the `.bib` file specified in the header of this document (here:
`references.bib`).

### Other cross-references

As already (partially) seen, Quarto includes a mechanism similar to the
bibliographic references for sections, equations, theorems, figures,
lists, etc. Have a look at [this
page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).

## Advanced formatting

Advanced formatting features are possible and documented (including interactive plots, pseudo-code, (Tikz) diagrams, Lua filters, mixing R + Python in the same document), but are beyond the scope of this simple introduction. We point several entries in this direction.
